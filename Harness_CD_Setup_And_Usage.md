[Harness](https://www.harness.io/) is the industryâ€™s first Software Delivery Platform to use AI to simplify your DevOps processes - CI, CD & GitOps, Feature Flags, Cloud Costs, and much more.

Follow below steps to install, configure and use Harness on Mac M2

## Prerequisite

On M2 Chip, we need to install Rosetta which enables a Mac with Apple silicon to use apps built for a Mac with an Intel processor.

```

```
Enable the below configurations in Docker Desktop, which will enable using Rosetta on M2.
